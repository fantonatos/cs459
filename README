rop/    Exploiting a stack buffer overflow to return-into-libc
        and exec /bin/sh. Binary is 32-bit statically linked
        and without stack canaries.

        AT: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (GNU/Linux),
        statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32,
        BuildID[sha1]=ff6285a3ba8c78600c64a0ad120a0099dca012de, not stripped

ptrace/ System call monitor using ptrace. Creates application-specific system
        call whitelists to detect and block malicious behavior. Detects the
        successful return-into-libc attack and kills the compormised process.

cfi/    Control-flow integrity enforcement using ptrace. Is capable of enforcing
        forward- and backward-edge integrity and prevents the return-into-libc
        attack.
